# WallDit
A very lightweight python program that sets your wallpaper, of images taken from Reddit, based on your set parameters (GUI version)

## GIF ([Binary .exe is finally released!](https://github.com/MrCappuccino/WallDit-QT/releases)):
![How it works](https://i.imgur.com/7HKFgZW.gif)

## Plans (Descending priority):
* Minimize and run in background
* Timer to automatically change wallpaper

## [Binary released, just extract the compressed files and double click the .exe](https://github.com/MrCappuccino/WallDit-QT/releases)

### If you want to contribute, feel free to do so, any help is appreciated!

## Setup (If you wanna run it yourself):
* download the modules
```
pip install praw
pip install pyside
```

## Launch:

* Version with CMD for debugging purposes

```
python WallDit.py
```

* No CMD version (.pyw)

```
python WallDit.pyw
```
